# 100-days-of-code-full-stack-development
Overview:

I am working to become a full stack web developer. I do not yet know exactly what "stack" to focus on. My goal is to be proficient enough in coding to get a Front End Developer job by the end of the year. From there I will continue working towards the Full Stack Developer goal.

I started this goal around August of last year and was doing very well for a few months. Through Christmas, January, and February, I haven't been doing much. And by much I mean nothing towards my goals. I was working on a WordPress site that I used as my excuse to avoid learning/ working on other things.

I'm hoping this 100 Days Challenge will give me a solid goal to reach which will motivate me to continue going. Whether each day brings a big achievement or a small one, at least I will be actively doing something to reach my end goal.

I suffer from a VERY short attention span and I get restless quickly, so committing to long periods of concentration are quite difficult for me. I will attempt the Pomodoro technique and see how I like it.



To hold myself accountable, I will tell specific family and friends who I know will be on my butt about finishing if I tell them to help me. I will also post my progress to Github, a couple Facebook groups, and maybe do the Twitter thing.

Overall Goals:

Become proficient in multiple languages
Write clean code
Figure out exactly which "full stack" I want to focus on
Become a Full Stack Web Developer
Rules:



Code at least 2 hrs/ day
Can miss 2 days/ 2 weeks, but must make up the time later whether by adding hours or do more days after 100
Push something to Github ideally every day, but at least once a week

Obstacles to Overcome:

Procrastinating
Not feeling defeated by the learning curves/humps
Be more active in online communities for support
Procrastinating
Don't stick too long on one thing if I get stuck. Move on and come back to it
Imposter Syndrome
Staying intently focused for 2 hrs at a time (Maybe try Pomodoro technique)
